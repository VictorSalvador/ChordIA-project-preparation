# Preparation for the Data Scientist position in the Chord-IA project

This repo contains three notebooks that resume my ability to work with and analyse symbolic music formats like MusicXML and MIDI.

## Files you can run

- tutorial_MIDI.ipynb : process a MIDI file (voice + piano), inspect its content, and export visualizations and different file formats.
- tutorial_musicxml.ipynb : analyze, extract, and convert a MusicXML file to MIDI. Also performs different analysis including notes, chords, intervals, key, and basic harmonic analysis.
- cancionero_medinaceli_analysis.ipynb : analyze a sample of works from the Spanish Renaissance *Cancionero de Medinaceli* corpus. Evaluates the similarity between pieces based on the distribution of intra-chord intervals, using Euclidean-distance hierarchical clustering (dendrogram) and dimensionality reduction (PCA) for visualization.
